# Emission Spectroscopy with ESPRESSO

This repository contains the emission spectroscopy pipeline that I developed during my PhD to analyse ESPRESSO data of WASP-76b.
The pipeline and results are presented in Costa Silva et al. (2024), A&A, 689, A8, 15 (DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/202449935).

The aim was to probe the dayside of this ultra-hot Jupiter to constrain its chemical composition, temperature structure, and atmospheric dynamics.
I focused on the species of neutral and ionised iron (Fe I and Fe II), and the properties that they revealed of this exoplanet: iron winds on the dayside!
